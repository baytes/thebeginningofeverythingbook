											<h2><strong><b>Press Release from Page Publishing For<br/>
										    <u>The Beginning of Everything</u> by Roy DePolitte</b></strong><br/></h2>
										    <br/>
											<p><strong><b><u>Headline</u></b></strong><br/>
											Author Roy DePolitte’s new book “The Beginning of Everything” is an engaging narrative imagining the very dawn of humanity. </p>

											<p><strong><b><u>Short Description</u></b></strong><br/>
											Recent release “The Beginning of Everything” from Page Publishing author Roy DePolitte is a compelling story bringing the earliest inhabitants of earth to life as never imagined before.</p>

											<p><strong><b><u>Long Description</u></b></strong><br/>
											Roy DePolitte, a resident of Tennessee, where he founded a nondenominational church, led jail and prison ministries, participated in international mission trips, and now raises cattle on a small farm while enjoying life as a husband, father, and grandfather, has completed his book “The Beginning of Everything”: a vivid depiction of the birth of humanity. </p>

											<p>Roy shares, “’The Beginning of Everything’ rolls out on many levels. First of all, it is a narrative about the most sparsely documented times in history. Characters are brought to life in action and dialogue, providing images of how life must have been. Vivid details decorate their environment and sensitively reveal their personal thoughts and emotions. Nature, in all of its peaceful glory, majesty, and power, both soothes the sensitive soul and horrifies the reader with scenes of unspeakable power and wrath. </p>

											<p>Time stands still as the ingenious, creative order of all that we know comes to life. Shocking revelations bear indisputable truths as the reader’s eyes are opened to what was right before them all the time on the pages of the Holy Scripture. The controversial clash between so-called science and faith finds common ground in the truths that overpower assumptions. </p>

											<p>Challenging questions are asked and answered in precise and convincing revelation, such as:  ‘Was Adam’s wife named Eve in the garden?’<br/><br/>

											Or, ‘Was sunlight the light that shined when ‘Let there be light’ was spoken?’” </p>
 
											<p>Published by New York City-based Page Publishing, Roy DePolitte’s book is a deeply evocative depiction of Creation that brings the characters to vivid and compelling life. </p>

 											<p>Readers who wish to experience this thought-provoking work can purchase “The Beginning of Everything” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play, or Barnes and Noble.</p>
