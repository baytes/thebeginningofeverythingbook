													<p style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: inherit;">Roy DePolitte acquired a double major in English and Language Arts from the University of New Orleans in the town where he was born and raised. During his youth, he attended Bible classes in school every day from kindergarten to twelfth grade. Later, as an English teacher, he enjoyed finding details that were normally overlooked in classic literature. His passion was always digging deeper and deeper into the souls of the poets and authors, unearthing gems that were right before the reader’s eyes. He later moved from the Deep South to Utah and now lives in a rural region of Tennessee. During his years in Salt Lake City, he established a nondenominational church, which remains today. In Tennessee, he founded another nondenominational church. During these years, he pastored and delivered sermons for over twenty years, led jail and prison ministries, and facilitated several small groups. He also attended mission trips to many countries in the Far East and the Eastern Bloc of Europe. Today he raises cattle on his small farm and enjoys life as a husband, father, and grandfather while composing study guides for his local church and finally finding time to write.</p>
