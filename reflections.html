											<h2><strong>A Fourteen Week Group or Personal Study Guide Program<br/> Expounding Upon The Book, <u>The Beginning of Everything</u></strong><br/>						</h2>

												<br/>
												<h3><strong>WEEK 1</strong></h3>
											</header>										
											<div style="border:solid 1px white; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; padding:10px;">
											<p><i>Read Section A in the book.  Write down any questions or comments that you’d like to explore further or discuss with your group.Take your time and thoughtfully answer the questions below. Be prepared to share and discuss all of your notes with your group.</i></p>
											
											<p><strong>Questions for Section A – “God Speaks to the Man”
											When Adam received consciousness for the first time, everything was surely new to him.</strong></p>
											
											<ol>
												<li>In reading the book, did you find it interesting that he discovered even the smallest things, such as, how to walk and run, how the wind can dry your skin, or what darkness must be like? <br/></li>
											Perhaps only babies discover their world in this way today. 
											<li>How do you think it must have felt to Adam, as an exceptionally intelligent adult, to be in a totally safe environment and discover one wonder after another? </li>
											<li>Do you wish that it could’ve been you?<br/>
											<li>The Bible begins with a description of an environment that is without form, void, dark, and with deep waters.  This place was already there when God said, “Let there be light.” </li></li>
											<li>Did it surprise you to realize that these things had to be created before light? The simple truth is that the light from the proclamation, “Let there be light”, was not the first thing created.</li>
											<li>Does this challenge your previous recollections of the Seven Days of Creation?</li>
											</ol>

												<h3><strong>WEEK 2</strong></h3>
											</header>
											<div style="border:solid 1px white; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; padding:10px;">
											<p><i>Read Section B in the book.  Write down any questions or comments that you’d like to explore further or discuss with your group.Take your time and thoughtfully answer the questions below.Be prepared to share and discuss all of your notes with your group.</i></p>
											<p><strong>Questions for Section B – “The Other Beginning”</strong></p>

											<p>
												<ol>
													<li>Have you ever seen drawings of God at a scene of The Creation, or any other image of Him with white hair and a white beard?</li>

													<li>If you have, did you realize that white hair is a sign of old age, and that God is neither old nor young since He always was and always will be?  He never has aged, not shown any signs of aging?</li><br/>

													There have many paintings, drawings, and sculptures of God the Father and Jesus.<br/><br/>
													<li>Before reading this book, and checking the reference, did you know that the bible strictly forbids making an image of Him?</li>
													<li>Although they were well-meaning in making the images, did you ever wonder why they did not read the Bible and see that it is forbidden?</li>
													<li>What do you think of when you envision God the Father?</li><br/>
													When the angels were made is a controversial subject because God chose not to reveal it in the Bible.  They had to be made before the fall, since Satan tempted the woman.  Yet they are not mentioned in the six days of creation.  They would not have been mentioned there because they were made for a totally different realm.  So, there are only two choices:  They were made before the world of man, or they were made during the earth’s creation but were not part of it. <br/><br/>
													<li>What do you think?</li>

											</header>
											<div style="border:solid 1px white; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; padding:10px;">
												<p><i>Read Sections A and C in the book.  Write down any questions or comments that you’d like to explore further or discuss with your group. Take your time and thoughtfully answer the questions below. Be prepared to share and discuss all of your notes with your group.</i></p>

											<p><strong>Questions for Sections A and C - “God Speaks to the Man” and “Back to Man’s Domain”</strong></p>

											<p>Two attributes of the Garden of Eden are that there was no death and that there was no sin.</p>
											<ol>
												<li>Take a moment and try to imagine a place in which nothing can die for any reason, even aging, and in which no sin could occur, either by you or by other people or creatures.</li>
												<li>Do you find it difficult to comprehend that Adam and Eve would give that up for the quest to be like God?</li>
												<li>Do you think you would have been more successful than Adam and Eve at keeping God’s only commandment?</li>
												<li>Why, why not?</li>
											</ol>

												<h3><strong>WEEK 4</strong></h3>
											</header>
											<div style="border:solid 1px white; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; padding:10px;">
												<p><i>Read Section D in the book.  Write down any questions or comments that you’d like to explore further or discuss with your group. Take your time and thoughtfully answer the questions below. Be prepared to share and discuss all of your notes with your group</i></p>

											<p><strong>Questions for Section D – “Days One Through Five”</strong></p>

											<p>We know that the sun was not made until Day Four, yet on Day One God said “Let there be light.” </p>
											<ol>
												<li>Have you ever thought about the fact that the light which was made on Day One was not made by the sun, or did you simply assume that it was sunlight?</li>
												<li>What does this say about reading texts carefully and drawing accurate conclusions?</li>
												<li>Before reading this book, did you ever notice that God put a firmament, or sky, between the waters upon the earth and waters that would be suspended above the earth? Of course we know that the thick band of water suspended above the earth is no longer there.</li> 
												<li>But can you imagine the benefit of having this insulating layer to protect all of creation upon the earth?</li>
												<li>What would breathing be like in that earthy greenhouse?</li>
												<li>What would plants and animals have looked like?</li>
											</ol>

												<h3><strong>WEEK 5</strong></h3>
											</header>
											<div style="border:solid 1px white; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; padding:10px;">
												<p><i>Read Section E in the book.  Write down any questions or comments that you’d like to explore further or discuss with your group. Take your time and thoughtfully answer the questions below. Be prepared to share and discuss all of your notes with your group.</i></p>

											<p><strong>Question for Section E – “Days Six and Seven”</strong></p>

											<p>We know from studying the six days of creation that the first three days provided environments for the creatures that were created respectfully on the second set of three days.</p>
											<ol>
												<li>What does this tell you about the logic and order of the way God created our planet and the universe?</li>
												<span>Today, many people, as reflected in classrooms, books, and on documentaries, proclaim an idea that men is a nuisance to nature, perhaps even its worst threat. </span>
												<li>How do you contrast this seemingly righteous love of nature with the fact that God gave man dominion and control over all of the creation?</li>
												<li>Have you ever noticed that the first woman was the only being created from an already created being?</li>
												<li>Do you have any thoughts about this unique characteristic of female humans?</li>
												<li>Why do you think God gave her this distinction?</li>
												<li>Does it reveal itself in women in today’s culture?</li>
												<li>How?</li>
												<li>Why do you think God rested on the seventh day?</li>
												<li>Was he tired?</li>
												<li>If not, could it have been as an example for us to keep one day out of seven holier than the others, with no work to be done on it?</li>
												<li>Do even religious people take the rest of the seventh day seriously?</li>
												<li>If so, are they considered fanatics by many?</li>
												<li>If not, why do you think that this example, and subsequent commandment, is ignored?</li>
											</ol>

												<h3><strong>WEEK 6</strong></h3>
											</header>
											<div style="border:solid 1px white; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; padding:10px;">
												<p><i>Read Sections E and J in the book.  Write down any questions or comments that you’d like to explore further or discuss with your group. Take your time and thoughtfully answer the questions below. Be prepared to share and discuss all of your notes with your group.</i></p>

											<p><strong>Questions for Sections E and J – “Days Six and Seven” and “The Necessary Changes”</strong></p>
											
											<ol>
												<li>Prior to reading the book, did you think that the woman in the Garden of Eden was named Eve at that time? After all, we talk about Adam and Eve in the garden. Technically, according to the Bible, she was named Woman by Adam in the garden, and her name was changed to Eve only after they were out of the garden.</li>
												<li>Does this thought surprise you? </li>
												<li>What do you think about the difference between the two names?</li><br/>
												<p>Woman means that she came from man, and Eve means that she is the mother of the living. </p>
												<li>How do women today deal with these two ancient embedded identities?</li>
												<li>Is one emphasized more than the other?</li>
												<li>Are both being ignored by many in today’s culture?</li>
											</ol>

											</header>
											<div style="border:solid 1px white; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; padding:10px;">
												<p><i>Read Section F and H in the book.  Write down any questions or comments that you’d like to explore further or discuss with your group. Take your time and thoughtfully answer the questions below. Be prepared to share and discuss all of your notes with your group.</i></p>

											<p><strong>Questions for Sections F and H – “The Rebellion of the Spirits” and “The Fall”</strong></p>
											
											<ol>
												<li>Isn’t it interesting that of all the sins possible, Lucifer chose to tempt Eve to commit the same sin that got him banished from heaven and removed from his close position with God? </li><br/>
												<p>That sin is, of course, to want to be equal to God, or to want to be a god yourself. </p>
												<li>Think of some examples how Lucifer still temps well-meaning people to commit the same sin.</li>
												<li>Relating to the previous question, isn’t it interesting that the very first of the Ten Commandments is, “You shall have no gods beside Me.”</li>
												<li>Wouldn’t this also include being your own god?</li>
												<li>Name some ways people consider themselves their own authorities, or their own gods.</li>
											</ol>

											<div style="border:solid 1px white; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; padding:10px;">
												<p><i>Read Section G in the book.  Write down any questions or comments that you’d like to explore further or discuss with your group. Take your time and thoughtfully answer the questions below. Be prepared to share and discuss all of your notes with your group</i></p>

											<p><strong>Questions for Section G – “Adam and Woman in the Garden”</strong></p>
											
											<ol>
												<li>Before reading this book, did you ever consider that there could not have been any children born in the Garden of Eden because the beginning of new life begins the procession towards death, and death was not possible until sin came into play?</li>
												<li>The Bible portrays children as a blessing from God, so their absence in the Garden of Eden is not a reflection of unimportance. Do you agree?</li>
											</ol>

												<h3><strong>WEEK 9</strong></h3>
											</header>
											<div style="border:solid 1px white; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; padding:10px;">
												<p><i>Read Section H in the book.  Write down any questions or comments that you’d like to explore further or discuss with your group. Take your time and thoughtfully answer the questions below.  Be prepared to share and discuss all of your notes with your group.</i></p>

											<p><strong>Questions for Section H – “The Fall”</strong></p>
											
											<p>Adam and Eve were possibly only in the garden for a matter of a few weeks. Adam had heard the direct words of God about the commandment to not eat of the forbidden tree.</p>

											<ol>
												<li>Do you find it surprising, interesting, or to be expected that he was so easily distracted and manipulated to violate the only command that was given to him? </li>
												<li>Do you think that men are easily distracted and manipulated today?</li>
											</ol>

												<h3><strong>WEEK 10</strong></h3>
											</header>
											<div style="border:solid 1px white; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; padding:10px;">
												<p><i>Read Section I in the book.  Write down any questions or comments that you’d like to explore further or discuss with your group. Take your time and thoughtfully answer the questions below. Be prepared to share and discuss all of your notes with your group.</i></p>

											<p><strong>Questions for Section I – “God’s Judgments”</strong></p>
											
											<ol>
												<li>Is it a surprising thought to you that the serpent from the Garden of Eden, a separate entity from Lucifer, was also punished?</li><br/>
												<p>Since he was punished, he must have had a choice to be possessed by the devil.  If not, it wouldn’t have been a sin that he committed. </p>
												<li>Does this change the way you feel about snakes today? </li>
												<li>For further thought, consider this:  If alcoholism is a disease, why does God say that drunkards shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? </li>
												<li>Isn’t alcoholism simply a sin which we can choose to reject, as the serpent chose to be possessed, therefore, deserving punishment?</li><br/>
												<p>A most controversial concept in today’s society is that part of the woman’s curse is that her husband would rule over her. </p>
												<li>Is this declaration by God voided because of the influence of feminism today, or does God’s word overrule popular cultural trends and philosophies?</li><br/>
												<p>The Bible states that the whole creation is under the curse for the sin that Adam committed in the Garden of Eden. </p>
												<li>Have you ever thought about nature being cursed because of man’s sin? </li><br/>
												<p>The Bible also states that nature will be redeemed when God’s children are redeemed.</p>
												<li>Does this connection, in the context of sin, between humans and other created things surprise you?  </li>
												<li>Why was Adam’s inclusion in the Fall so significant?</li>
											</ol>

											<div style="border:solid 1px white; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; padding:10px;">
												<p><i>Read Section K in the book.  Write down any questions or comments that you’d like to explore further or discuss with your group. Take your time and thoughtfully answer the questions below. Be prepared to share and discuss all of your notes with your group.</i></p>

											<p><strong>Questions for Section K – “The Population of the Earth”</strong></p>
											
											<ol>
												<li>Have you ever considered the truth that the first human being ever born was also the world’s first murderer? </li>
												<li>Does this say anything about the power of sin and its quest to lure people into it? </li> 
												<li>How do jealousies, bitterness, guilt, and shame reveal themselves today?</li><br/>
												<p>According to the Bible, Cain brought an ordinary sacrifice to God while Abel brought a much more precious and valuable sacrifice. </p>
												<li>Do you think that religious people today give their best to God, or just what is left over? </li>
												<li>Are you more like Cain, or Abel?</li>

											</header>
											<div style="border:solid 1px white; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; padding:10px;">
												<p><i>Read Section L in the book.  Write down any questions or comments that you’d like to explore further or discuss with your group. Take your time and thoughtfully answer the questions below. Be prepared to share and discuss all of your notes with your group. </i></p>

											<p><strong>Questions for Section L – “Man’s Depravity”</strong></p>
											
											<p>God commanded people to populate the earth, but they seemed to want to stay grouped together, despite His command. </p>

											<ol>
												<li>Why do you think it was unpleasant or difficult for people to travel to distant destinations? </li><br/>
												<p>After all, the land was all gathered into one place at that time. There were no islands nor separate continents. </p>
												<li>So why did they refuse to occupy the connected land upon the earth?</li>
												<li>Are people stubborn and rebellious like this today when God gives them simple commands? </li>
												<li>Why?  </li>
												<li>What are some simple commands that God gives in the Bible that are generally ignored in our culture?</li><br/>
												<p>Whenever we hear the account of Noah’s Ark, we are told, and easily picture, all of the animals entering the ark “two by two.” </p>
												<li>Did it surprise you to find out that the clean animals were in sevens, not pairs?</li><br/>
												<p>With people living hundreds upon hundreds of years, and reproducing throughout those years, there must’ve been great variations in physical traits by the time the flood occurred. </p>
												<li>Since there were only eight individuals who boarded the ark, isn’t it probable that many traits of people who died were not found in the genetic make-up of those eight? </li>
												<li>Isn’t it interesting to think that some people may have had physical characteristics that we will never see again, because only those eight people were chosen as the only survivors? </li>
												<li>Can you imagine what some of the people who perished in the flood must have looked like?</li>
											</ol>

												<h3><strong>WEEK 13</strong></h3>
											</header>
											<div style="border:solid 1px white; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; padding:10px;">
												<p><i>Read Section M in the book.  Write down any questions or comments that you’d like to explore further or discuss with your group. Take your time and thoughtfully answer the questions below. Be prepared to share and discuss all of your notes with your group.</i></p>

											<p><strong>Questions for Section M – “The Flood, Not Millions of Years”</strong></p>
											
											<p>Concerning the Great Flood, we normally assume that the waters were caused by rain.  The Bible says, however, that the fountains of the deep were broken up first, then the windows of heaven were opened, and it rained for 40 days and 40 nights. </p>
											
											<ol>
												<li>Why do you think people who relay the account of the flood ignore the fact that waters first came from deep within the earth? </li>
												<li>Doesn’t that kind of pressure and force being released from below easily explain the formation of relatively new mountain ranges and deep fissures in the Earth’s surface?</li><br/>
												<p>Science is defined as “knowledge about or study of the natural world based on facts learned through experiments and observation.”(Merriam-Webster)</p>
												<li>Does anyone have any facts that the earth is millions of years old, or are there only theories? </li>
												<li>Are there any experiments that have been conducted that prove that the earth is millions of years old?</li>
												<li>Who would have conducted them?</li>
												<li>Was anyone there to observe the earth being made millions of years ago? </li>
												<li>Have you ever thought about what happens to something when it is blown up in an explosion, or when it is left in place, or even in motion, over a long period of time? </li><br/>
												<p>Big bangs destroy what order was there before, and time rusts, decomposes, and evaporates materials.  </p>
												<li>Isn’t it a ridiculous assumption that a big explosion, which would cause chaos, could ever result in the wonderful order that we see in nature? </li>
												<li>Doesn’t this thought make you realize that the concept of everything in nature being created by chaotically colliding elements in the universe is nothing more than a theoretical belief system, and a religion that is actually very difficult to believe? </li>
												<li>Could it be that Darwin’s theory of evolution is accurately named a “theory” for a good reason – that it cannot be proven? </li>
												<li>Isn’t it more reasonable that an all-powerful being created things that are   much more complicated than we will ever comprehend?</li>
												<li>Why do you think that the world at large rejects the concept of an all- powerful Creator?</li>
												<li>Is the theology of denying God as the Intelligent Creator excusable? (Romans 1:18-22)</li>

												<h3><strong>WEEK 14</strong></h3>
											</header>
											<div style="border:solid 1px white; -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1px white; padding:10px;">
												<p><i>Read Section N in the book.  Write down any questions or comments that you’d like to explore further or discuss with your group. Take your time and thoughtfully answer the questions below. Be prepared to share and discuss all of your notes with your group.</i></p>

											<p><strong>Questions for Section N – “The Repopulation of the Earth”</strong></p>
											
											<p>Skeletons and fossils of animals which no longer exists are often found today. </p>
											
											<ol>
												<li>If it were important to God to maintain all of the varieties of animals which ever lived, don’t you think he would’ve kept them from going extinct?</li>
												<li>What do you think about philosophies which embrace going through much expense and hardship on the part of humans to keep even the most insignificant insect from going extinct?</li>
												<li>Do you think that these efforts are in tune with God, or that those who embrace them just do not understand Him and His sovereignty?</li><br/>
												<p>When the people began to build the tower of Babel, they wanted to make a name for themselves. Of course, gathering together in cities was, once again, disobedience to God’s repeated command to travel abroad and populate the earth.</p>
												<li>Do you think that the desire to make a name for themselves was a form of pride that should have been avoided? </li>
												<li>Do people today try to make a name for themselves, even if it results in doing the wrong thing? </li>
												<li>What are some examples? </li>
												<li>Do you think that most people today care more about what other people think about them than about what God thinks about them?</li><br/>
												<p>The Bible records much wickedness before the flood leading to the Tower of Babel, and it continues in mankind today.</p>
												<li>Isn’t it interesting, and most wonderful, that the creation, which is displayed in nature today, although much less majestic than in the Garden of Eden, is still so awesome that it, in itself, reveals the nature of God?</li>
												<li>Why do you think it is that people can look at the complexities of nature, most of which can never even remotely be duplicated by man, and doubt that there was an intelligent designer for all of these complexities? </li>
