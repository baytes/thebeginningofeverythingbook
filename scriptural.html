											<h2><strong>Main Scriptural Themes:</strong><br/></h2>
											<p>
											Scriptural themes are found throughout the book.  In both the printed and eBook versions, a Scriptural Reference Guide can be found on pages 161-199.  These numbered sets of scriptures reference 244 end note citations are located throughout the book. As you read the pages of the book, you may want to go from the end notes of the Scriptural Reference Guide to authenticate the line with Biblical reference.  Or, you may just want to keep reading and check out the scriptural references later.</p>

													In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. …And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.

												<p>
													For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
